<!-- BRIEF -->
- In this repository, you will find the basic code for understanding various Data Structures in **Java**.

- The code in this repository is intended to provide a starting point for learning and practicing Data Structures. It includes the basic implementation of each Data Structure, as well as some examples of how the Data Structures can be used.

- I hope that these examples can serve as a helpful reference for others who are learning data structures, or who are simply interested in seeing how these concepts can be implemented in Java.

- *I will be continuously updating this repository as I learn new concepts and add new examples, so be sure to check back regularly for updates. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out to me. Happy coding!*
